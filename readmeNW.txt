ON LIVE: delete field resource type_old (and all its data)

16.4.19 Got entity browser to insert fields from Resource node.
Next: change icon in toolbar, hide fields and show again on click, icon to show "can expand". Style classes resource-xyz-embedded for title author and summary.

15.4.19 changed Resource Type to a taxonomy. Resources types listed on a Resource need to connect to the resource page at /resources. This is a view and should filter by the category selected. Failed so far.

6.3.19 transferred from lando to ddev as lando kept losing drush
