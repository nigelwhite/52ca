24.4.19 updated remote sites to drupal and module updates.
On local - added a new content type for Source, added to embed button, trying to get popup working.

19.4.19 updated core and modules on local and pushed to repo. Have not pulled to Digital Ocean.

16.4.19 Got entity browser to insert fields from Resource node.
Next: change icon in toolbar, hide fields and show again on click, icon to show "can expand". Style classes resource-xyz-embedded for title author and summary.

15.4.19 changed Resource Type to a taxonomy. Resources types listed on a Resource need to connect to the resource page at /resources. This is a view and should filter by the category selected. Failed so far.

6.3.19 transferred from lando to ddev as lando kept losing drush
